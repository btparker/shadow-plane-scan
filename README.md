::Compilation Instructions::
Must be with an apps folder of openframeworks (http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/), and include the OpenCv addon (should be included with the newest release). To compile, type 'make', and run './bin/3D' Only tested with linux, but one can follow compilation instructions on the openframeworks site for other operating systems.

Data files and folders go in bin/data.


::Settings File::
In the bin/data folder there is a settings file, the top portion of which has various things to edit. Absolute path to calibration and scanning images (sorry).

::Usage::
Other than following the text instructions, numbers 1-5 switch between output images (grayscale, temporal). Once scanned, 'o' switches the 3D view on and off. With the 3D view, right click and drag zooms in and out, middle mouse click and drag pans, left mouse click and drag rotates.
